    <p>Dependency Graphs and their Applications, Part I: System Startup and Shutdown
Jay M. Coskey, 2011-08-18

Descriptions of algorithms for creating dependency graphs are often written
in shorthand, sometimes with simplifying assumptions, such as that the input
data has no cyclic dependencies, or that the graph has only one root.
I thought it would be instructive to work out these algorithms for myself.
I did so in Python, to which I’m a relative newcomer.

The code referenced from this post:
  * Creates dependency graph based on input data listing nodes (referred
    to as “components”) and dependencies (which refer to a “component” and
    a “requirement” to clearly differentiate the two parts of a dependency).
  * Detects cycles, and remediate them by removing a minimal number of
    edges needed to remove the cycle.  (But not necessarily the smallest
    number possible.)
  * Determines a topological ordering of the components.
  * Uses the topological ordering of components to compute the earliest
    possible startup times for all the components listed in the dependency
    graph, given that each component can only begin to start up after all
    its pre-requisites have completed their startup process.
  * Computes the possible shutdown times, as above, but in reverse.  This
    uses the reverse of the topological ordering mentioned above.

Future blog posts on dependency graphs will likely cover:
  * Using the Boost Graph Library (from C++, Python, or another language)
    to simplify the care and feeding of dependency graphs.
  * Creating Bayesian network for probabilistically determining root cause
    of failure among a network of interdependent systems.
  * Compiler optimizations.
